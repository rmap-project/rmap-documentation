# Useful Ontologies

To support a broad variety of disciplines, RMap does not enforce any restrictions on the ontologies used in the  _additional assertions_  section of an  [RMap DiSCO](../api/disco-media-type.md). Ideally, additional assertions will utilize ontologies that are stable, describe the relationships accurately, and are broadly adopted. Below are some ontologies that the RMap Tech Team have found useful for transforming from a variety of metadata to RDF graphs.
