## Request

#### HTTP Method & Path
```
GET /resources/{uri}/events
```
uri = HTTP encoded URI of Resource to retrieve Events for.

This path also supports the following querystring parameters:

| Parameter| Description |
|------|----|
| from | Date from (UTC). Applied to start date of the creation Event for the object that the Resource is contained in. Format as _yyyyMMddHHmmss_ or _yyyyMMdd_ <br>e.g. 20150101120000|
|until | Date to (UTC). Applied to start date of the creation Event for the object that the Resource is contained in. Format as _yyyyMMddHHmmss_ or _yyyyMMdd_ <br>e.g. 20150101120000|
|agents| Comma separated list of RMap Agent URIs. This will filter by the Agent that generated the graph the Resource is contained in.|
| page | Page number as integer of greater than 0. Default is 1.|
| limit | Number of URIs to retrieve. Default is 200. If there are more URIs than the limit, the system will automatically paginate and add `page=1` to your query string.

Example URL: _https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/resources/rmap%3At1g1jwt916/events?from=20150101120000&page=1&limit=5_

#### Response Body
Example (application/json):
```
{
"http://purl.org/ontology/rmap#Event": [
    "rmap:547d7wmg6g",
    "rmap:dncjsxm6jk"
    ]
}
```
Example (text/plain):
```
rmap:547d7wmg6g
rmap:dncjsxm6jk
```

#### Possible Response Codes
| Code| Description |
|---------|------|
| 200| OK|
| 303 | See other (if there are more results than the limit specified) |
| 404| Not found |
| 406| Not acceptable (if incorrect Accept header defined) |
| 500| Internal server error|
| 503| Service unavailable|

## Behavior
1.  RMap searches for triples whose subject or object match the Resource URI provided
2. The system compiles a list of RMap Object URIs that asserted the triples collected in (1) and applies the optional filters to the list
3. If no RMap Objects contain the Resource provided after filters are applied, an HTTP Not Found response is returned with a basic default error.
4. If there are matching Objects, an HTTP OK response is returned containing a list of matching Event URIs serialized in the format defined by the `Accept` header.
5. If any errors result in this process not being completed successfully, the user will receive the appropriate error message.

## Example

#### Request
```
curl -i https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/resources/https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.7265%2Fn59p2ztg/events
```

#### Response
Response as application/json:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{
    "http://purl.org/ontology/rmap#Event": [
        "rmap:zkh1893hs2",
        "rmap:fn2z34v1q0",
        "rmap:q2bvq83shb",
        "rmap:r2280gbmpp"
    ]
}
```
If there are too many results to list on a single page, then the request will offer a new link to being pagination. Note that some clients will automatically follow the `see other` location:
```
HTTP/1.1 303 See other
Location: https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/resources/https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.7265%2Fn59p2ztg/events?from=20150101120000&until=20190325221459&limit=200&page=1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

[no content]
```
If the client automatically redirects, the new `Location` will load with the `Content-Type` listed. Otherwise, the client can manually follow the Location address to begin pagination. At this point the response will be similar to the first simple example.
