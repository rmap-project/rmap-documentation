## Request

#### HTTP Method & Path
```

uri = HTTP encoded URI of Agent to retrieve Events for. 

This path also supports the following querystring parameters:

| Parameter| Description |

|until | Date to (UTC). Applied to Event start date. Format as _yyyyMMddHHmmss_ or _yyyyMMdd_ <br>e.g. 20150101120000|
| page | Page number as integer of greater than 0. Default is 1.|
| limit | Number of URIs to retrieve. Default is 200. If there are more URIs than the limit, the system will automatically paginate and add `page=1` to your query string.

Example URL: _https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/agents/rmap%3At1g1jwt916/events?from=20150101120000&page=2&limit=5_

#### Possible Response Codes
| Code| Description |
|---------|------|

## Behavior
1.  RMap searches for an Agent using the URI provided by the client.
2. If no matching Agent is found, an HTTP Not Found response is returned with a basic default header.
3. If a matching Agent is found, RMap finds all Events that cite the Agent as the `prov:wasAssociatedWith` value.
4. If any matching Events are found, an OK response is returned with a list in the format defined by the `Accept` header. If no matching Events are found, an empty list is returned.
5. If any errors result in this process not being completed successfully, the user will receive the appropriate error message.

## Example

#### Request
```
curl -i https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/agents/rmap%3At1g1jwt916/events?from=20150101120000
```

#### Response
A simple response:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{
"http://purl.org/ontology/rmap#Event": [
    "rmap:547d7wmg6g",
    "rmap:dncjsxm6jk"
    ]
}
```
If there are too many results to list on a single page, then the request will offer a new link to being pagination. Note that some clients will automatically follow the `see other` location:
```
HTTP/1.1 303 See other
Location: https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/agents/rmap%3At1g1jwt916/events?from=20150101120000&until=20190325221459&limit=200&page=1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

[no content]
```
If the client automatically redirects, the new `Location` will load with the `Content-Type` listed. Otherwise, the client can manually follow the Location address to begin pagination. At this point the response will be similar to the first simple example.
