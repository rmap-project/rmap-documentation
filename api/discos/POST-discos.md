## Request

#### HTTP Method & Path
```
POST /discos
```
Example URL: _https://test.rmap-hub.org/api/discos_
#### Request Headers
| Header | Value |
|---------|------|
| Basic Auth * | Your API key and secret (key:secret)|
|Content-Type *<br>(choose one) | text/turtle <br>application/vnd.rmap-project.disco+rdf+turtle <br>application/rdf+xml <br>application/vnd.rmap-project.disco+rdf+xml <br>application/ld+json <br>application/vnd.rmap-project.disco+ld+json|
 
 \*  Required

#### Request Body
The body should contain a new RMap DiSCO. See the [DiSCO media type](disco-media-type.md) for the correct format, and view the [example](#example) below to see a full request/response. Also consider reviewing the [_DiSCO Design Best Practices_](https://github.com/rmap-project/rmap-documentation/blob/master/guides/disco-design-best-practices.md) for some guidance on how to form the ideal RMap DiSCO.

## Response
#### Response Headers
| Header | Value |
|---------|------|
| Location* | https://{api-path}/discos/{new-disco-uri}|
| Link* | &#60;https://{api-path}/events/{disco-creation-event-uri}&#62;; rel= "http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasGeneratedBy"|

\* Appear on every Created response.

#### Response Body
The body will vary depending on your ID minter, but should looks something like this:
```
ark:/12345/new-disco-uri
```
#### Possible Response Codes
| Code| Description |
|---------|------|
| 201| Successfully created|
| 400| Bad request (DiSCO is not correctly formatted)|
| 401| Unauthorized (agent does not have rights to create a DiSCO|
| 413| Request too large|
| 415| Unsupported media type (if something other than a DiSCO is posted)|
| 500| Internal server error|
| 503| Service unavailable|

## Behavior
1.  The user provides a DiSCO as RDF, an API key, and the content-type of the request.
2.  The system checks the API key. Insufficient authorization will result in failed transaction and request to check API key credentials.
3.  Once successfully authenticated, RMap checks whether this is the first DiSCO created by the Agent. 
    * If it is the first DiSCO, and the Agent doesn't already exist in the triplestore, a new `rmap:Agent` graph is created based on information provided at sign up, along with an `rmap:Event` capturing information about the Agent creation.
    * If the Agent already exists, the Agent information is loaded into memory.
4.  RMap verifies that the `Content-Type` provided is a supported type, if not an _Unsupported Media Type_ notification is returned.
5. If the media type is correct, RMap verifies that the DiSCO is valid according to the `Content-Type` cited. If it is not, a _Bad Request_ response is returned.
6.  If the DiSCO is correctly formed, the system assigns a unique `rmap:DiSCO` URI to the package received.
7. The graph provided by the client is captured as an `rmap:DiSCO` in the RMap triplestore.
8. A new `rmap:Event` is generated for the RMap DiSCO creation. This captures the URI of the new DiSCO, the URI of the authenticated `rmap:Agent` that made the assertion (and the key ID if configured to do so), the date/time of the event, the event type (creation), and the target object type (`rmap:DiSCO`).
9. If any errors result in this process not being completed successfully, the entire transaction will be rolled back and the triplestore will be unchanged. The user will receive an appropriate error message.
10. If successful, the client receives a Created HTTP response containing links to the new DiSCO and Event URI.
