## Behavior
1.  RMap searches for a DiSCO using the URI provided by the client.
2. If no matching DiSCO is found, an HTTP Not Found response is returned with a basic default header.
3. If a matching DiSCO is found, RMap notes the System Agent that created that DiSCO.
4. RMap finds all DiSCOs labelled as versions of the DiSCO submitted that were created by the same System Agent as the one submitted.
5. RMap formats the version list as a Memento timemap. To read more about the Timemap format, see the [Memento website](http://mementoweb.org/guide/).
6. If any errors result in this process not being completed successfully, the user will receive the appropriate error message
7. Otherwise, the client receives an OK response with a content type “application/link-format”
8. The body of the response contains a list of links formatted in the same way as the list of links in a Response Header. These links include:
	* URL and date for all DiSCO versions (“memento”s)
	* A link to the timemap page (“self”)
	* A link to the /discos/{uri}/latest path for the DiSCO
