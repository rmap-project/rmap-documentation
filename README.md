# RMap Technical Documentation

## Project Description
The RMap Project was originally funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was undertaken by the [Data Conservancy](https://dataconservancy.org/), [Portico](https://www.portico.org/), and [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/). The goal of RMap is to make it possible to preserve the many-to-many complex relationships among scholarly publications and their underlying data, thereby supporting the continual development of scholarly communication and digital publishing. Active work on the RMap project began in April 2014. The first public production instance of RMap was hosted by the [Johns Hopkins University, Sheridan Libraries](https://www.library.jhu.edu/). All code for RMap can be found in the [RMap GitHub account](https://github.com/rmap-project).
